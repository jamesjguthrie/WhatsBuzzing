EMAIL FROM MEMBER: DO I LEAVE MY DRUG ADDICT PARTNER?: My fiancé an I have been together for 3 years, we are both in our early 20s we have a one year old and another on the way. I love him so much it hurts.. But he's a drug addict and sells drugs for a living.. We got our son taken from us when he was 2 months old because he failed a drug test for heroin. My son is currently in the custody of my fiancés dad although we live with him it's not the same.. It hurts me that I do not have custody of my own child. With this second one on the way I'm scared they will take him away from me too. My fiancé still does heroin and sells it too, I work a full time job even though I'm 6 months pregnant.. I  fear the only way to keep my baby is to leave him.. I love him, but I love my children more.. I let him control me last time and the result was the loss of my son.. What should I do?!?! Help please

Every driver gets in front once in awhile and every driver at that time gets a blow out and hits the wall once in awhile. Just part of racing. All in all driver and team did a very good job and seems to be building from each race. It takes years for driver and team to get to the top.

You should leave him! You are a mother and your children should be the main priority in your whole world. Why would you let them be around a heroin addict, let alone actually choose to lose custody of them? What kind of father, or man, would let you do that? Don't your children deserve better? I know you love him and the thought of leaving him hurts, but you have to do what is right by your children. xxR

Our centres are still full to the brim with cats so today's pets of the day are another fabulous feline duo!

Imogen and Sadie are a great wee pair of characters aged 8-13 months.

Imogen is the more confident of the two and is always first to greet people.

Sadie was a little timid when she first arrived but is beginning to come out of her shell.

These girls would love to find their forever home where they can explore and have plenty of fuss and attention.

If these could be the cats for you please call our ANGUS CENTRE near Dundee on 03000 999 999 :)

“We already knew that the UK Government was spending thousands of pounds of public money on polling that has never seen the light of day, these new figures show that the true cost to the taxpayer is actually £140,000.

“It is staggering that the Westminster government thinks it is acceptable to spend taxpayer’s money in this way – and for the Secretary of State for Scotland to plead ignorance in the way that he did just isn’t credible."

All of Scotland know why they wouldn't publish its because they favour the YES Scotland Campaign. This is the very same reason they hid the McCrone Report for nearly forty years and have since hidden the Scottish Devolution Files they don't want us knowing the truth. Westminster's unionist coalition are now so desperate they will try to keep everything they can from us and hope we will remain ignorant of the true facts, that Scotland has what it takes and more to be a successful Independent country.
Vote YES its for the BEST.
